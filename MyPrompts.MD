Alright, imagine you have some toys in a box. A boolean expression is like asking a question about those toys, and the answer can only be yes or no. For example, you might ask, "Are there any red cars in the box?" If there is at least one red car, the answer is yes; if there are no red cars, the answer is no. So, a boolean expression is a question where the answer can only be true or false, like asking if something is true or not.
